//This project is only for re-useable cross-application(non-rangr-specific), cross-platform code.
//So things like Time-Ago or GeoCoordinates shouldn't really be in here.

//Rather, what should really happen is to understand their underlying purpose/responsibility...
//Time??, Spatial??, and then have special dedicated libraries created to hold them.

//However, until re-useability across several client apps is needed, it stays Rangr.shared
