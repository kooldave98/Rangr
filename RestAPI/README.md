# Rangr-API

For local testing, follow these steps. [Still in progress]

**This has been tested with VS2015 and SQLServer Express 2014 running on Windows 10 running in a parallels VM on a Macbook Pro.**

1. Download or clone Rangr-API to a Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 machine with Visual Studio 2013 or VS2015. You can download a free version of VS 2015 Community here: https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx

2. Make sure you have sql server express 2014 installed on your machine, download SQL express for free here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=42299

3. Make sure you have the latest Azure SDK installed, this lets you run the Azure Storage emulator. It usually comes as a separate extension to Visual Studio.

4. Download Xamarin Studio, you get one month with the full version free. And if you are a student, its forever free.
Mac setup: This is the setup I recommend, clone Rangr and point the baseUrl above to the IPAddress of the Machine hosting your copy of Rangr-API
You need to open up port 1898.....
Windows setup: You will only be able to run the Android app, unless you have a Mac accessible to you on your network.
